# 📌 **About This Portfolio**
This repository showcases **hands-on cybersecurity investigations** performed manually using:

- Linux log analysis  
- Threat detection logic  
- Structured SOC methodology  
- Behavioral + contextual reasoning (AI-Proof)  
- Early-stage Incident Response techniques  

Everything here is built to demonstrate **real, practical security skills** — not theoretical notes.

---

# 🧭 **Career Direction**
**Goal:** Become a **Threat Detection / IR Analyst**, specializing in:

- Attack reconstruction  
- Log correlation  
- Pattern analysis  
- Human-driven reasoning (where AI still fails)  
- High-impact investigations  

Short-term: SOC Analyst I → SOC Analyst II  
Mid-term: **Incident Response**  
Long-term: **Threat Hunter / DFIR**

# 🧠 **AI-Proof Skills (Human-Only Capabilities)**

These are skills recruiters value MOST in 2025+ because AI cannot replicate them reliably:

- Contextual reasoning  
- Understanding human motivation behind attacks  
- Judgment under uncertainty  
- Business impact evaluation  
- Distinguishing error vs malicious intent  
- Attack path intuition  
- Deciding when NOT to alert/escalate  

Your portfolio is being built **around these strengths**.

# 🛠️ **Technical Skills**
(Expanding weekly during CYBERSCHOOL)

- Linux commands & log inspection (auth, syslog)  
- SIEM fundamentals (Splunk/Elastic/Wazuh – coming)  
- Log parsing & pattern detection  
- Network basics (ports, protocols, traceroute, unusual traffic)  
- Terminal-based investigations  
- Markdown reporting for IR/SOC  
- Early-stage Incident Response logic  

---

# 🚀 **Training Program: CYBERSCHOOL**
A custom, high-performance cybersecurity learning system designed to:

- Build real SOC/IR skills  
- Avoid noise and unnecessary theory  
- Focus on human decision-making  
- Develop detection logic and reasoning  
- Create weekly, portfolio-ready investigations  

Weekly uploads will appear in `/reports` and `/playbooks`.
