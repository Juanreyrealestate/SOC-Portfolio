## About This Portfolio

This repository showcases hands-on cybersecurity investigations performed manually using:

- Linux log analysis  
- Threat detection logic  
- Structured SOC methodology  
- Behavioral + contextual reasoning (AI-Proof)  
- Early-stage Incident Response techniques  

Everything here is built to demonstrate **real, practical security skills** — not just theoretical notes.

## Career Direction

**Goal:** Become a Threat Detection / Incident Response Analyst, specializing in:

- Attack reconstruction  
- Log correlation  
- Pattern analysis  
- Human-driven reasoning (where AI still fails)  
- High-impact investigations  

**Path:**

- Short-term: SOC Analyst I → SOC Analyst II  
- Mid-term: Incident Response / MDR  
- Long-term: Threat Hunter / DFIR

## Repository Structure

- **`/reports`** – Finished SOC-style investigations in Markdown (incident reports, log analysis, threat reconstruction).  
- **`/playbooks`** – Playbooks and runbooks for detection and response (step-by-step actions, conditions, and escalation paths).  
- **`/logs`** – Raw or sample logs used for analysis while building the investigations.  
- **`/notes`** – Working notes, scratch space, intermediate reasoning.  
- **`/securityplus`** – Structured Security+ study notes, aligned with exam domains and mapped to real SOC/IR tasks.  
- **`/archive`** – Older material and experimental content, kept for reference.

This structure is designed so that a recruiter can quickly open `/reports` and immediately see **how I think and investigate as a SOC analyst.**

## Featured Investigations

### ▶️ 01 — First Log Analysis (Beginner SOC Exercise)

**Skills demonstrated:**  
Basic terminal navigation · authentication log expectations · error handling · human reasoning vs machine indicators  

**Report:** [`/reports/01_first_log_analysis.md`](/reports/01_first_log_analysis.md)

> More investigations are being added under `/reports` as part of the CYBERSCHOOL Training Program (Blue Team, IR, detection logic, real threat scenarios).

---

## Security+ Study Track (`/securityplus`)

As part of my CYBERSCHOOL training, I am building **Security+ aligned notes** that combine:

- Core exam domains (network, identity, cryptography, risk, governance)  
- Real SOC / Incident Response context  
- Practical explanations instead of rote memorization  

These notes are in `/securityplus` and show that I am building a **solid theoretical + practical base** for entry-level security roles.

## AI-Proof Skills (Human-Only Capabilities)

These are skills recruiters value MOST in 2025+ because AI cannot replicate them reliably:

- Contextual reasoning  
- Understanding human motivation behind attacks  
- Judgment under uncertainty  
- Business impact evaluation  
- Distinguishing error vs malicious intent  
- Attack path intuition  
- Deciding when NOT to alert/escalate  

My portfolio is being built specifically to highlight these.

## Technical Skills (Growing Weekly)

- Linux commands & log inspection (auth, syslog)  
- Log parsing & pattern detection  
- Network basics (ports, protocols, traceroute, unusual traffic)  
- Identity & access control fundamentals (IAM, SSO, OAuth, RBAC/ABAC)  
- Cryptography basics (TLS, PKI, hashing, symmetric/asymmetric crypto)  
- Incident Response workflow (NIST-inspired)  
- Markdown reporting for SOC / IR  

Security+ track (`/securityplus`) is expanding alongside the practical investigations.

## Training Program: CYBERSCHOOL

A custom, high-performance cybersecurity learning system designed to:

- Build real SOC/IR skills  
- Avoid noise and unnecessary theory  
- Focus on human decision-making  
- Develop detection logic and reasoning  
- Create weekly, portfolio-ready investigations  

New content appears regularly in `/reports`, `/playbooks`, and `/securityplus`.

---

## Why Hire Me?

- I demonstrate structured thinking and clear, written communication.  
- I understand how attackers behave, not just what logs say.  
- I combine technical skills + human reasoning, which is essential in modern SOC roles (especially with AI tools in the mix).  
- My learning path is optimized for **real-world performance**, not academic memorization.  
- I produce clean, professional documentation (like this portfolio).
